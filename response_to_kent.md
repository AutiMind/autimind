# Response to Kent

Hi Kent,

Thank you for following up on our conversation yesterday and for speaking with Valentina about our situation.

I completely understand the startup program criteria regarding multiple businesses on a single account. That makes perfect sense from a program integrity standpoint. I'll go ahead and create a new dedicated account specifically for setting up the new business under Autimind to ensure we're in full compliance with the program requirements.

Would you be able to assist with transferring the relevant services and configurations to the new account once it's created? I want to make sure we handle the migration properly and maintain continuity of our services during the transition. However, I'd prefer to keep autimind.com in its current configuration for now, as we have some important meetings coming up and I want to avoid any potential disruptions to our primary domain during this critical period.

Once I have the new account set up, I'll reach out to Valentina directly to get the process moving forward. I really appreciate you both taking the time to clarify this and help us navigate the proper steps.

Thanks again for your assistance and support!

Best regards,
Andrea
