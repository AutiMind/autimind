        Our Story
      </h2>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 max-w-4xl mx-auto leading-relaxed">
        Founded in 2023 with a deeply personal mission, AutiMind began with a heart for neurodiverse learners. Inspired by our niece, who is on the autism spectrum, we believed AI could serve as a personalized learning assistant for those who need it most. While we've evolved into an AI software development company building solutions like AstroLMS and ZServed, our autism-focused origins continue to guide our commitment to creating accessible, intelligent technology.
