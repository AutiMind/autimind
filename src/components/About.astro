        Our Story
      </h2>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 max-w-4xl mx-auto leading-relaxed">
        Founded in 2023 with a bold mission, AutiMind began with a heart for neurodiverse learners and a belief that AI could serve as a personalized learning assistant for those who need it most. Inspired by our niece, who is on the autism spectrum, we set out to make learning more intelligent, inclusive, and accessible through emerging technologies.
