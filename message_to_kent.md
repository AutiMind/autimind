# Message to Kent - Cloudflare Business Setup

Hi Kent,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out regarding setting up our new business infrastructure under Cloudflare, specifically under the Autimind umbrella.

We're looking to establish a new business entity within our Cloudflare ecosystem and would greatly appreciate your assistance with the transfer and setup process. Your expertise would be invaluable in ensuring everything is configured correctly from the start.

One important note: we'd prefer to keep autimind.com in its current configuration for now, as we have several critical meetings coming up and want to avoid any potential disruptions to our primary domain during this period.

Would you be available to help us with:
- Setting up the new business account structure
- Transferring relevant services and configurations
- Ensuring proper isolation between the existing Autimind setup and the new business
- Guidance on best practices for the transition

Please let me know your availability and if there's any additional information you'd need from our end to get started.

Thanks for your continued support!

Best regards,
[Your name]
